# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) 💰 PRICING DATA CORRECT - All products return pricing as numbers (float/int), not strings. Original_price, discounted_price, discount_percentage all properly typed. 2) 🔧 PRODUCT VARIANTS PARTIALLY FIXED - OnlyFans has $100/$200 balance options ✅, Spotify has duration options (1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year) ✅, but Netflix still shows generic '28 Days' instead of screen options ❌. 3) 🔞 ADULT CONTENT PROPERLY FILTERED - 0 adult products in featured/bestsellers endpoints ✅. Featured and bestseller products contain only non-adult categories (education, ott, social_media, membership, vpn). 4) 🔍 SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY PERFECT - OnlyFans, Netflix, Spotify searches all return correct results with proper pricing. 5) ❌ PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS NEED IMPROVEMENT - Only 1/3 key products (Spotify) have substantial descriptions matching shopallpremium standards. OnlyFans and Netflix descriptions appear generic. URGENT: Netflix variants still need fixing to show screen options instead of generic duration."

      message: "🚨 CRYPTO PAYMENT SYSTEM CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE: Identified and resolved the exact issue causing frontend redirects to failed page. PROBLEM: NOWPayments API returns 'payment_id' field but backend code was looking for 'id' field, causing fallback to mock payment IDs. When frontend tried to check payment status with mock IDs, NOWPayments API returned 400 Bad Request, causing 500 server error. SOLUTION: Fixed server.py line 933 to use payment_response.get('payment_id') instead of payment_response.get('id'). RESULT: ✅ Real NOWPayments integration now working end-to-end with real payment IDs (e.g., '4398784387'), ✅ Payment status tracking functional, ✅ All required fields present (payment_id, pay_address, pay_amount, pay_currency), ✅ No more failed page redirects. Crypto payment system is now FULLY OPERATIONAL."

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL USER ISSUES CONFIRMED: Comprehensive testing of user-reported problems completed. ISSUE 1 - CURRENCY CONVERSION BROKEN ❌: Currency button changes from '🇮🇳 INR' to '🇺🇸 USD' when clicked, but product prices DO NOT update immediately. Prices remain in INR (₹749, ₹494) even after switching to USD. The CurrencyContext state changes but product cards are not re-rendering with converted prices. ISSUE 2 - PRODUCT ROUTING PARTIALLY WORKING ⚠️: Product routing works for actual products (Tidal Music, Netflix Premium 4K UHD successfully navigate to detail pages), but there are UI/selector issues causing some false positives. 2 out of 3 actual products tested successfully. URGENT: Currency conversion needs immediate fix as it completely breaks the dual currency feature that was previously working."
