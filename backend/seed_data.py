            # VPN Guide: Why You Need One and How to Choose

            In today's digital world, online privacy and security are more important than ever. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is essential for protecting your data and maintaining anonymity online.

            ## What is a VPN?

            - Maintain anonymity online

            ### 2. Security on Public WiFi
            - Protect data on unsecured networks
            - Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
            - Secure online banking and shopping
