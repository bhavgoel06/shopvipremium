The AI engineer successfully transformed  from an MVP into a feature-rich e-commerce platform. The work trajectory demonstrates an iterative, problem-solving approach, meticulously addressing user feedback. Key achievements include the integration of Nowpayments for hosted crypto payments, development of a comprehensive, secure admin panel, and a significant UI/UX overhaul with rebranding and a dark theme. The engineer also focused on gateway compliance, modifying site content to remove risky language for payment processor approval. The final phase involves deploying the complete application to a user-provided VPS, a complex process currently underway. Challenges included React Hooks errors, duplicated UI elements, and persistent Python environment issues during VPS setup, which were systematically debugged and resolved with user assistance and troubleshooting tools.

The objective for  (originally ) is to establish an SEO-optimized e-commerce platform for reselling digital subscriptions. The platform needs to support a product catalog of over 80 unique items with detailed, SEO-friendly descriptions, original/strike-through pricing, and reviews. A key aspect is a professional, Apple-level UI/UX, including a user-specified Modern Dark Theme. It requires dual USD/INR currency support with auto-conversion for crypto payments. A secure, WooCommerce-level admin panel for comprehensive management (products, orders, users, content, settings) is essential, accessible only via secure login. User authentication (login/registration) is mandatory. The site must be SEO-optimized, include functional Telegram/WhatsApp contact buttons, and feature accurate legal content (Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Contact Us) verbatim from . Payment options include UPI, Cryptocurrency (Nowpayments), and Card payments, with dedicated success/failure pages. Branding must consistently be Shop VIP Premium, and content must be carefully positioned as digital productivity tools and freelancer utility bundles to ensure gateway compliance, avoiding terms like premium subscriptions or genuine accounts.

*   **SSH Connection Reset**: The SSH connection dropped once (), requiring the engineer to guide the user on how to reconnect and reactivate the .
*   **Partial File Creation**: The user preferred creating files separately rather than a single mega-script. The engineer adapted, providing the backend files (, , ,  in parts) and base frontend files (, , , , ) in a step-by-step manner.

**Current State:**
The core backend files (, , , ) and initial frontend setup (, , , , , , , , , , , , , ) have been provided to the user as  commands to be run directly on the VPS. The user has just confirmed that the last set of core frontend pages (AdminDashboard) were created. The site branding and gateway compliance changes previously implemented have been integrated into these deployment files.

The immediate next step is to continue providing the remaining frontend pages and complete the full application setup on the VPS.
