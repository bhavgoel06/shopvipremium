The previous AI engineer successfully developed the  e-commerce application, integrating crypto payments, an admin panel, and a significant UI/UX overhaul. The primary challenge transitioned to VPS deployment on Ubuntu 24.04, plagued by persistent package management, Python dependency, MongoDB configuration, and Nginx syntax issues. The engineer provided multiple one-click deployment scripts, iteratively addressing errors like missing packages (, , ), Python alternative conflicts (, ), and Nginx directive errors. A critical domain typo ( vs ) was identified and corrected. Despite extensive fixes, the deployment process has been unstable. The current focus is on resolving a Certbot SSL installation failure due to Nginx configuration and a critical bug where products are no longer visible on the site, suggesting database or backend communication issues.

The objective for  is to be an SEO-optimized e-commerce platform specializing in digital productivity tools and freelancer utility bundles to comply with payment gateway regulations. It requires a catalog of over 80 products, each with SEO-friendly descriptions, original/strike-through pricing, and review capabilities. A professional Apple-level UI/UX with a Modern Dark Theme and real-time USD/INR currency conversion (fixed at 90 INR/USD) for crypto, card, and UPI payments is mandatory. A secure, WooCommerce-level admin panel is essential for comprehensive management of products, orders, users, and site settings (including theme and currency rate), accessible via secure login. User authentication (login/registration) is required. The site must feature functional Telegram/WhatsApp contact buttons and accurate legal content (Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Contact Us). Branding must consistently be Shop VIP Premium, avoiding terms like premium subscriptions or genuine accounts. All features must be included in the deployment script for a fresh VPS installation.

Unable to handle repository shortcut 'universe' (and variants like , , , ): These are the central deployment scripts. They are crucial for automated setup on a fresh VPS, handling system dependencies, application installation, configuration, and service management. They have been iteratively modified to address Ubuntu 24.04 compatibility, package availability, Python environment issues, Nginx configuration, and now payments/SSL. The latest version attempts to deploy the full application with all features.
-   : Stores critical backend configurations including MongoDB URL, JWT secret, and Nowpayments API keys. Continuously updated during deployment script creation and bug fixes to ensure correct environment variable usage.
-   : The core FastAPI backend. Modified to include new site settings endpoints for admin control and to ensure API routing includes the  prefix.
-   : Script responsible for populating the MongoDB database with product data. It was checked and re-run during bug fixes to ensure product data was available, especially when products went missing.
-   : Stores frontend environment variables, notably  and . Crucial for frontend-backend communication and payment integration. Its  was explicitly set to  and  to 90.
-   : Main React component; configures routing and integrates global contexts. Modified to include the new AI theme CSS.
-   : Manages currency state and conversion. Significantly modified to ensure immediate price updates across the application and to implement the 90 INR/USD exchange rate.
-   : Displays individual product information. Modified multiple times to ensure correct currency display, proper product routing via slugs, and Add to Cart functionality.
-   : Handles the checkout process. Completely rewritten/modified to correctly display prices based on selected currency and payment method (USD for crypto, USD/INR equivalent for card, INR for UPI).
-   : A primary landing page component. Modified to integrate the new AI/Tech theme and ensure currency context is used for price formatting, replacing hardcoded logic.
-   : New file created to define the AI/Tech Modern Theme, implementing visual styles like glassmorphism and neon effects for a cutting-edge look.
-    (configured by ): Nginx server block configuration. Continuously modified to fix syntax errors, handle frontend routing, proxy backend API calls ( prefix), and integrate Certbot's ACME challenge for SSL. This file's content was repeatedly adjusted due to deployment errors.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete SSL certificate installation (requires Nginx and Python dependencies to be correctly configured for Certbot).
-   Verify product visibility and full application functionality on the deployed site.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was deep in the process of debugging the deployment of  to the user's VPS, encountering a series of critical failures. The user had reported that nothing is opening and later, after a domain typo correction, that the site is broken, all my products are not visible and SSL was still not installed.

The last actions involved:
1.  **Diagnosis**: The AI engineer diagnosed a DNS issue where  was resolving to a different server ( with openresty) instead of the user's actual VPS. The engineer advised the user to fix DNS A records.
2.  **PM2 Worker Fix**: The user inquired why does it show 2? (referring to PM2 instances). The engineer updated  in  to set  and restarted PM2.
3.  **SSL Re-attempt & Failure**: The engineer re-attempted SSL installation using Certbot. While the DNS  check passed (domain was now resolving to the VPS's apparent IP), Certbot failed with a  error on the  path. This indicates Nginx is not correctly serving these challenge files.
4.  **Products Missing (CRITICAL)**: Simultaneously, the user reported that all my products are not visible on the site. The engineer initiated a multi-pronged fix:
    *   Ran Python code to test MongoDB connection and count products (e.g.,  or a low number).
    *   Attempted to **re-seed the database** by running .
    *   Modified the Nginx configuration () to explicitly add a  block pointing to  for Certbot.
    *   Created the directory  and set permissions.
    *   Reloaded Nginx and restarted the backend.
    *   Re-attempted SSL installation.
    *   Performed final checks on product visibility via backend API and frontend.

At the very end of the trajectory, the SSL still failed, and the product visibility status was being actively checked and addressed, with the previous engineer trying to verify the backend products. The application is in a state where core content (products) is reported as missing on the frontend, and the site is not yet secured with SSL.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to confirm product visibility on the site and then thoroughly debug the Nginx configuration for Certbot to resolve the SSL installation failure.
