The previous AI engineer effectively navigated the user's iterative requests, evolving from a general SEO query to building a complete e-commerce platform. Initially, the focus was on understanding the user's need for an SEO-optimized site to sell premium subscriptions. The AI engineer provided a detailed blueprint and then proceeded to build an MVP, including a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. A significant portion of the conversation revolved around user concerns about self-management and understanding the provided tools, leading the AI engineer to develop command-line and web-based admin interfaces, complete with demonstrations and documentation. The project is now in a state of feature expansion, specifically focusing on product catalog comprehensive, dual currency support, enhanced UI/UX, and robust admin capabilities, setting the stage for a production-ready system with a clear handover strategy.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Defines the data models (e.g., Product, Category, User) using Pydantic, ensuring data consistency and validation for MongoDB interactions. This was created early in the build.
- : Handles the connection to MongoDB using  from the environment. This was created and then likely modified to fix the  issue.
- : The core FastAPI application. It defines API endpoints (e.g., , ) for fetching data, handling orders, and potentially admin operations. This was created and possibly updated as new backend features were added.
-  (and later ): Scripts for populating the MongoDB database with initial sample products, categories, and blog posts.  was used initially, then  was introduced for more extensive data.
- : A Python script providing command-line functionalities for managing the website, including adding/updating products, viewing statistics, etc., serving as a powerful backend admin tool.
- : A simplified Python script for quickly adding new products via the command line with minimal input.
- : A backend script/endpoint designed to manage and update static website content, likely interacting with .
- : A Python script used to display daily business reports and key performance indicators from the database, providing insights into sales, visitors, etc.
- : The main React component defining the application's structure and routing. It was updated multiple times to include new pages, components (like ), and contexts.
- : The React entry point. Also likely updated for context providers or global configurations.
- : Manages user authentication state and logic across the frontend. This was a core component created for user login/registration.
- : A newly created context to manage the global currency selection (USD/INR) state across the application, allowing components to access and update the selected currency.
- : A new React component for the web-based admin interface, designed to provide a more visual and user-friendly way for the user to manage the site compared to command-line tools. This was created in response to the user's request for visual tools.
- : A JSON file designed to store easily editable website text and content. This allows for content updates without modifying React components directly.
- Frontend Pages (, , , , , , , , , ): These React components represent the various pages of the e-commerce site, built incrementally to match the blueprint.
- , : CSS files for styling, primarily using Tailwind CSS.
- , , : Markdown files created to provide comprehensive documentation and visual guides for managing the website, detailing the use of both command-line and web-based admin tools.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of building out the more advanced features and comprehensive content as per the user's latest detailed request (Chat Message 162). This includes:
1.  **Product Expansion**: Adding a larger and more diverse product catalog (50+ products like Parallels Desktop, LinkedIn, Perplexity, etc.) to make the site look more complete and less like a demo.
2.  **Dual Currency Support**: Setting up the functionality for both USD and INR, including a currency switcher on the page top and displaying both currencies on the checkout page.
    -   A key file created for this is , which will likely manage the selected currency state in the frontend.
3.  **Comprehensive Data Seeding**: A new script, , has been created to populate the database with this expanded product list and other necessary data (like reviews). The AI engineer is about to run this seeder.
4.  **Admin Panel Refinement**: While a web-based admin interface () was recently introduced and demonstrated, the user's latest request re-emphasizes the need for a full-fledged admin panel to manage everything.
5.  **UI/UX Enhancement**: Focus on professional fonts, proper button alignment, and overall design that conveys trust and avoids a cheap website appearance.
6.  **SEO Self-Sufficiency**: Ensuring all on-site SEO strategies are implemented to negate the need for the user to perform off-site SEO.
The immediate next action is to run the  to populate the database with the expanded product set.
