The previous AI engineer successfully transformed an MVP e-commerce platform into a professional, world-class application, addressing extensive user feedback iteratively. Initial work established a React, FastAPI, MongoDB stack with dual currency, user authentication, and basic admin functionality. The core challenge was an aggressive UI/UX overhaul to achieve an Apple-level design, expanding the product catalog from 27 to 60+ items including adult content, fixing broken features, and enhancing trust elements.

The engineer methodically tackled issues: expanding the product catalog, refining product card designs, improving navigation, implementing dynamic content (terms/privacy), fixing image loading, enhancing payment options (removing PayPal, adding UPI/Crypto), securing and enhancing the admin dashboard, and integrating social proof and modern UI patterns from design references like Mobbin. Each iteration involved directly addressing user critiques on visual appeal, functionality, and security, culminating in a highly polished and fully functional e-commerce site.

<product_requirements>
The user required an SEO-optimized e-commerce platform, , for reselling premium subscriptions (OTT, software, VPN, professional tools, adult content, OnlyFans). Key requirements included a comprehensive catalog of 80+ unique products with SEO-optimized descriptions, original vs. strike-through pricing, and self-generated 4-5 star reviews with randomized dates. The UI/UX needed to be professional, trustworthy, and Apple-level, featuring flowing animations, liquid display, correct company logo images, proper fonts, button alignment, and fast loading. Dual currency support (USD/INR) with a top switcher and checkout display was essential. A full-fledged, secure admin panel was required for inventory management (including one-click set out of stock), tracking, blog posts, product management, and integration settings. User authentication (login/register) was a core feature. The site needed to be self-sufficient for SEO, scalable, include working Telegram/WhatsApp contact buttons, and disclaimers. Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions content were to be based on reference sites. Payment options must exclude PayPal and include UPI, Crypto, and Card. A running disclaimer banner and a professional shop logo were also requested.
