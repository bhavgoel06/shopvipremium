The previous AI engineer successfully established an MVP e-commerce platform with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, fulfilling initial requests for an SEO-optimized site. Key achievements included implementing dual currency support, a robust user authentication system, and a functional command-line/web-based admin panel with stock management. Significant effort was dedicated to improving the UI/UX towards an Apple-level design using , creating new modern homepage and product card components. Despite these advancements and a self-declared production-ready status, the user provided extensive feedback highlighting critical shortcomings: insufficient product catalog size (27 vs. 80+ desired), persistent design issues (e.g., cheap look, button alignment, static elements), non-functional features (contact buttons), and inconsistent branding. The AI engineer has acknowledged these points and is currently in the process of a major overhaul, starting with a comprehensive product data scrape and re-seeding to meet the 80+ product count, including adult content, and further refining the UI/UX.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an SEO-optimized e-commerce platform, , for reselling premium subscriptions (OTT, software, VPN, professional tools, adult content, OnlyFans). It needs a comprehensive catalog of 80+ unique products with SEO-optimized descriptions, original vs. strike-through pricing, and self-generated 4-5 star reviews. The UI/UX must be professional, trustworthy, and Apple-level, featuring flowing animations, liquid display, correct product images (company logos), proper fonts, button alignment, and fast loading. Dual currency support (USD/INR) with a top switcher and checkout display is essential. A full-fledged admin panel is needed for inventory management (including one-click set out of stock), tracking, blog posts, product management, and integration settings. User authentication (login/register) is a core feature. The site should be self-sufficient for SEO, scalable, and include disclaimers and working Telegram/WhatsApp contact buttons. Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions must be based on provided reference sites.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on a significant overhaul of the application, driven by the user's latest, more demanding feedback. The primary immediate focus is on dramatically expanding the product catalog. The current catalog has 27 products, but the user explicitly requested 80+ products, including adult content, to be scraped from  and . To facilitate this, a new script, , has been created. The work is currently paused at the point of preparing the data models to accommodate new category types (e.g., for adult content) before this mega seeder can be run.

Concurrently, the AI engineer is also tasked with perfecting the Apple-level UI/UX. While a  and  were introduced with  for animations and a dark theme, the user's feedback indicates persistent design issues such as button alignment, a cheap feeling, and a lack of fluidity across the entire site. The issue of the Shop For Premium brand name not being consistently used across the site is also a standing concern. Additionally, the user pointed out missing features like working Telegram/WhatsApp contact buttons and disclaimers. The persistent loading screen issue on the frontend, despite multiple attempts to debug and bypass it, also remains unresolved and needs attention to ensure fast loading times.
