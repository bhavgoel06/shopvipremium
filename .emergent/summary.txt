The AI engineer undertook an extensive and iterative development process for , transforming an MVP into a feature-rich e-commerce platform. The core challenge involved achieving an Apple-level UI/UX, integrating Nowpayments, and ensuring absolute data accuracy (pricing, variants, descriptions) by meticulously scraping . The trajectory highlights a pattern of addressing persistent issues, particularly with data integrity, leading to repeated attempts at scraping and database corrections. Initial fixes for pricing display and adult content visibility were refined based on user feedback. A major focus was the comprehensive overhaul of the cryptocurrency payment flow to ensure proper redirection and an improved user experience, including real-time order status tracking. The engineer consistently diagnosed issues by examining both frontend and backend code, and confirmed fixes via testing agents and screenshots, demonstrating a problem-solving approach centered on precise data synchronization and user journey optimization.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Defines data schemas for the application. It was updated to include , , , ,  for Nowpayments integration. Changes involved making  optional in  and ensuring the  field from MongoDB is popped for Pydantic model compatibility.
-   : Manages database interactions. Modified  for search. Added methods for order and payment management (, , , , ). Crucially,  and  were updated to handle the  field from MongoDB to prevent Pydantic validation errors.
-   : The FastAPI backend entry point. Updated product search endpoint. New API endpoints were added for Nowpayments (, , , ). The crypto payment endpoint () was heavily refactored to use the  endpoint for hosted payments, handle  from NOWPayments, and construct dynamic  with order and payment IDs. A new  endpoint was added for real-time order status polling.
-   : Integrates with Nowpayments. Originally used a  endpoint for manual crypto transfers. It was modified to use the  endpoint for hosted payment page redirection, and  and  were updated to include order and payment IDs for frontend tracking. Environment variable loading was fixed.
-   : A new script created to specifically correct product pricing inconsistencies to match .
-   , , , : These are new, iterative Python scripts created throughout the trajectory. They were used to scrape and import detailed product data (descriptions, features, variants, pricing) from  into the MongoDB, addressing data accuracy issues.  specifically targeted the generic variant issue.
-   : Main React router. Updated to include , ,  routes.
-   : Navigation bar. Cart icon updated. Adult Content category visibility was adjusted based on feedback.
-   : Product display component. Modified to correctly format and display prices with proper decimals.
-   : Handles currency conversion. The  function logic was implicitly confirmed correct for its purpose, but its usage in  was refined.
-   : Homepage. Switched to . Adult content display was managed by removing adult products from featured/bestseller categories.
-   : Displays all products. Updated to use . Faced intermittent loading issues.
-   : Checkout page. Significantly refactored for Nowpayments. Removed PayPal and added UPI/Card/Crypto. It was systematically modified to remove crypto currency selection (as Nowpayments handles it), redirect to the , fix the currency conversion from INR to USD for crypto payments by consistently using  and , and prevent cart clearing until payment is confirmed.
-   : Dedicated page for successful orders. Completely rewritten to fetch and display real-time order status based on  or , show payment details, clear the cart, and provide a professional confirmation experience with contact information for support.

The immediate next step, based on the very last user interaction, is to finalize the UX improvements on the  page:
- Remove the phrase within 30 minutes from the email text displayed on the order success page.
- Add specific contact options (Telegram/WhatsApp) for delivery support on the order success page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on refining the post-payment user experience and product data accuracy, responding directly to the user's feedback.

The engineer had just implemented a significantly improved crypto payment flow using Nowpayments:
1.  **Hosted Payment Page**: The system now redirects users to a Nowpayments-hosted page () instead of expecting manual crypto transfers. This was achieved by changing the backend's Nowpayments API call from the  endpoint to the  endpoint (in  and ).
2.  **Correct Amount Calculation**: A critical bug was fixed in  where the INR amount was incorrectly being sent as USD to Nowpayments. The fix involved ensuring  was correctly calculated using the  function and the actual  from , resolving the issue where a â‚¹494 INR product was showing as ~00 USDT instead of ~.95 USD.
3.  **Real-time Order Status**: The user experience after payment was revamped. Instead of waiting on the Nowpayments page, users are immediately redirected to . This page now dynamically fetches and displays the payment status (e.g., Waiting for payment confirmation, Payment Successful, Order Processing) by polling a new backend endpoint ( in  and ). The frontend now correctly parses  from the URL to find the order.
4.  **Cart Clearing UX**: The cart is now cleared only *after* the payment is confirmed/successful on the  page, preventing user panic from an empty cart immediately after placing an order.
5.  **Product Data Accuracy**: All product descriptions, features, and variants were updated to be word-for-word exact copies from  using a new dedicated scraping script (), resolving issues with generic variants.
6.  **Order Description**: The payment page now displays specific product names in the order description instead of a generic Premium subscription.

The last interaction from the user (Chat Message 584) was a request to remove within 30 minutes and add Telegram/WhatsApp contact information for delivery on the  page. The engineer confirmed these as quick improvements and began implementing them (Chat Message 585 onwards), making edits to .
