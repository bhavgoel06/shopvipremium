The previous AI engineer successfully developed the  e-commerce application from an MVP, integrating core features like Nowpayments crypto payments, a comprehensive admin panel, and a significant UI/UX overhaul. The primary focus shifted to VPS deployment, which proved challenging due to persistent Ubuntu system and package management issues. The engineer initially attempted to provide a multi-script deployment, then consolidated into a one-click script uploaded to GitHub. However, repeated failures related to missing , , , , , , and  packages forced iterative script revisions. These revisions included drastic simplifications (e.g., single Python file, no React), which the user rejected, re-emphasizing the need for the full application. Currently, the strategy has shifted to a two-phase approach: the user is manually executing a detailed list of commands to fix the Ubuntu system's repositories and install core dependencies, after which the engineer will provide the script for the application itself.

The goal for  is to be an SEO-optimized e-commerce platform selling digital subscriptions, specifically digital productivity tools and freelancer utility bundles to ensure payment gateway compliance. It needs a product catalog of over 80 items with SEO-friendly descriptions, original/strike-through pricing, and reviews. A key feature is a professional Apple-level UI/UX with a Modern Dark Theme and dual USD/INR currency support via auto-conversion for crypto payments. A secure, WooCommerce-level admin panel is essential for comprehensive product, order, user, and content management, accessible via secure login. User authentication (login/registration) is mandatory. The site must be SEO-optimized, include functional Telegram/WhatsApp contact buttons, and accurate legal content (Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Contact Us) verbatim from . Payment options include UPI, Cryptocurrency (Nowpayments), and Card payments, with dedicated success/failure pages. Branding must consistently be Shop VIP Premium, avoiding terms like premium subscriptions or genuine accounts.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to deploy the  application to the user's VPS at  using a one-click  script, uploaded by the user to their GitHub repository . The user had requested a full site, with all the packs, details, products, payment features, admin panels everything.

**Chronology of Recent Events:**
1.  **Initial One-Click Script ():** The engineer created a comprehensive script to handle all aspects of deployment (system dependencies, backend, frontend, database seeding, Nginx, PM2, security).
2.  **Persistent Installation Errors:** The script repeatedly failed on the user's VPS due to missing or unlocatable packages (e.g., , , , , , , ).
3.  **Iterative Script Fixes:** The engineer provided multiple revised versions of  (e.g., , , ) attempting to address these compatibility issues by:
    *   Replacing  with .
    *   Removing specific Python 3.11 versioning.
    *   Adding  repositories.
    *   Replacing  with .
    *   Implementing multiple fallback installation methods and manual pip installs.
    *   *Temporarily* simplifying the application architecture to a single Python file with no React/Nginx/MongoDB to guarantee a working deployment, which the user rejected.
4.  **User Frustration and Reiteration:** The user expressed significant frustration with the repeated failures and explicitly rejected simplified solutions, re-emphasizing the need for the *full* React/Nginx/FastAPI/MongoDB platform.
5.  **Current Strategy Shift:** In response, the engineer has adopted a two-phase approach. The user is currently executing a detailed set of manual commands directly on the VPS. These commands are designed to perform a complete system fix, ensuring all necessary Ubuntu repositories are configured and essential dependencies (Node.js, Python3, pip, Nginx, MongoDB) are correctly installed and started.
The user's last action was initiating these manual system fix commands.

<optional_next_step>
Create the second script for the complete website installation (backend, frontend, database seeding, PM2, Nginx config) once the user confirms successful completion of the manual system setup.
